## Design [Backend]

The codebase offers a set of good practices but deliberately leaves the opportunity to improve lots of internal design choices.

For example it might be worth thinking:

* Is the organisational structure good enough? What does "good" look like?
* Did we manage to draw the "right" boundaries in our domain?
* Do our abstractions make sense? Can we "justify" their existence? Are there alternatives?
* etc
